# ExploratoryData
Exercises developed to meet project assignments

### Firts.. Excuse my English

I don't speak English, but is not a problem. I read, and sometimes write. 

### Next.. Enjoying the exercises and hoping my classmates made the same.

# Note:

In the graphs on the axis of the "X" labels appear in Spanish, 
this happens because the operating system I use has this in "es-Ve", ie, Spanish-Venezuela.


The dataset used it got the following link:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

1. It down directly in the working directory and work on each of the exercises requested.

2. To identify the amount of memory required Use the command: object.size ().

3. I clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1.

4. Finally, develop as indicated in course assignments.

Thanks at all.
